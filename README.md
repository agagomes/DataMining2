# DataMining2

Project developed for the curricular unit "Data Mining 2" of the University of Porto
This aims to compare the performance of different recommendation strategies on a dataset supplied by Farfetch, a world-leading platform in the luxury fashion online market founded in 2007 by a Portuguese entrepreneur.
In the file users_brands.csv, you have data consisting of a sample of purchases over a period of time.
The main goal of this practical assignment is to build a recommendation model to obtain recommendations of brands for a set of users.
